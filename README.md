# SystemDesign
This repository contains my structured solutions to various Low-Level Design (LLD) problems, covering real-world system components such as Ticket Management Systems, Notification Systems, and more. Each design includes class diagrams, modular code, and clear abstractions following SOLID principles and object-oriented design best practices.
